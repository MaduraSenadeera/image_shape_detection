# image_shape_detection
Simple Matlab code allowing the detection of a certain shapes from an image. This specific code has been initialised to identify all occurrences of a specific number. This has been made possible with the use of a template to determine eigen values. This values can be then utilised to find objects within an image that contain similar shape structure to that stored with the eigen values.

This basic functionality has many applications that can be explored into futher!
